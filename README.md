# A template for creating a web app with Go and React.

The backend is a Go web server that serves up static html and javascript files.

The front end is a React app that gets compiled into a single javascript file.

# Running the app locally:
### To run the Go server: 
install `air` with `go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest`, and use the `air` command.

### To run the front end:
Run `npm install -y`, then run `npm run dev` if you want to build-and-watch, or `npm run build` if you want to build the app without watching.
